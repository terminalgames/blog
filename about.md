# What
Terminal Games is a blog about text based command-line games played on a terminal.
There are many games for the terminal scattered on the Internet. Some of them dates back to the mid 1970's that are still actively maintained.
The goal of this site is to create the most expansive list of tty games available on the Internet. 

# How

The biggest problem with command-line games is how to install and get it up and running on different environments. 

* Linux
* Mac OS X 
* Microsoft Windows

My goal is to provide instructions to get the game up and running in each of these environments.

# Why

Because I was introduced to PC gaming in the early 1980's and the simplistic elegance  of terminal games is what I want to keep alive through this blog.
